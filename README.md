# HartRAO Raster Scan Tutorial

## What is a Solar Raster Scan?

A solar raster scan is a technique used in solar astronomy to create detailed images of the Sun's atmosphere. It involves systematically scanning the solar disk and recording the intensity of solar radiation at each point. The resulting data can then be used to create a two-dimensional image of the Sun at a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths.

During a solar raster scan, a telescope is pointed at the Sun and moved across the solar disk in a regular pattern, typically in a grid-like pattern. At each point in the grid, the telescope measures the intensity of solar radiation at a specific wavelength or range of wavelengths. This process is repeated until the entire solar disk has been scanned.

The resulting data can be used to create images of the Sun's atmosphere at different heights or temperatures, revealing details about the Sun's magnetic fields, plasma dynamics, and other features. These images can provide insights into the processes that drive solar activity and help scientists understand how the Sun affects Earth's environment.


## What is the HartRAO radio telescope and how does is perform a solar raster scan?

The HartRAO (Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory) radio telescope is a large dish antenna located in South Africa that is primarily used for radio astronomy observations. However, it is also capable of performing solar observations. To perform a solar raster scan, the telescope is pointed at the Sun and then moves in a regular pattern across the solar disk, making a series of measurements at different points. This creates a grid of data that can be used to study the solar atmosphere.
